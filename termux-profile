# The 'e' alias will connect to the already running daemon.
# A little speedier than the 'emacs' command because the init
# file has already been loaded.

# The 'e' alias will also start the daemon if it has crashed or failed to start

# Consider that any changes to the emacs init file will not take affect until after the daemon
# reloads. To kill a running daemon, run 'top', find the process number for the emacs daemon in
# the first column, and kill it with 'kill 9582' or whatever the number is.

# Note: you may have to edit the above alias depending on where emacs stores it's server file.
# Check the parent directory of 'emacs10444' to get the correct url

# Run `source .profile` to have these changes take effect immediately.
